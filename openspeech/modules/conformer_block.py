class ConformerBlock(nn.Module):
    r"""
    Conformer block contains two Feed Forward modules sandwiching the Multi-Headed Self-Attention module
    and the Convolution module. This sandwich structure is inspired by Macaron-Net, which proposes replacing
    the original feed-forward layer in the Transformer block into two half-step feed-forward layers,
    one before the attention layer and one after.

    Args:
        encoder_dim (int, optional): Dimension of conformer encoders
        num_attention_heads (int, optional): Number of attention heads
        feed_forward_expansion_factor (int, optional): Expansion factor of feed forward module
        conv_expansion_factor (int, optional): Expansion factor of conformer convolution module
        feed_forward_dropout_p (float, optional): Probability of feed forward module dropout
        attention_dropout_p (float, optional): Probability of attention module dropout
        conv_dropout_p (float, optional): Probability of conformer convolution module dropout
        conv_kernel_size (int or tuple, optional): Size of the convolving kernel
        half_step_residual (bool): Flag indication whether to use half step residual or not

    Inputs: inputs
        - **inputs** (batch, time, dim): Tensor containing input vector

    Returns: outputs
        - **outputs** (batch, time, dim): Tensor produces by conformer block.
