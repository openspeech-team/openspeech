class PointwiseConv1d(BaseConv1d):
    r"""
    When kernel size == 1 conv1d, this operation is termed in literature as pointwise convolution.
    This operation often used to match dimensions.

    Args:
        in_channels (int): Number of channels in the input
        out_channels (int): Number of channels produced by the convolution
        stride (int, optional): Stride of the convolution. Default: 1
        padding (int or tuple, optional): Zero-padding added to both sides of the input. Default: 0
        bias (bool, optional): If True, adds a learnable bias to the output. Default: True

    Inputs: inputs
        - **inputs** (batch, in_channels, time): Tensor containing input vector

    Returns: outputs
        - **outputs** (batch, out_channels, time): Tensor produces by pointwise 1-D convolution.
